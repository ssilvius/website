There are so many design choices that feel like a live service game, like Destiny. Bioware tried this before with Anthem and they built a looter shooter without loot. 

  1. Three classes, that are all equal in use but play fairly different
  1. no healer.
  1. Each distinct area has it's own hub and quest givers, the first time I walked into one, I felt like I was meeting Davrim for the first time. 
  1. Loot feels just like destiny, you get the same things over and over and upgrade them from whites to golds. There is a selection of unique, legendary items of course.
  1. Verric is Zavala.
  1. Races and factions feel like Destiny of old.

But enough of that. Progression feels like Assassin's Creed, combat feels like God of War. The real point here is, BioWare has played a lot of good games over the last decade. They took what they learned in them and made it their own. In a pretty good feeling way. 

Following the cliffhanger ending of Dragon Age: Inquisition Tresspasser and the looming threat of the Fade spilling into the world of Thedas, Veilguard promises to be the next major step in the saga. But does it live up to the legacy of its predecessors? The answer is, yes.

## Story & Worldbuilding: Expanding the Fade and Beyond 
Set years after the events of Inquisition, Veilguard introduces players to a new protagonist—an elite member of the Veilguard, a faction tasked with defending against supernatural threats linked to the Fade. The game opens with a world teetering on the brink, as the rifts between the physical world and the Fade grow wider, unleashing chaos across Thedas.

The story centers around the player's mission to uncover the source of these disturbances, with a strong emphasis on the growing tension between mages, templars, and various factions. In typical Dragon Age fashion, political intrigue, personal vendettas, and moral quandaries abound, making for a narrative that is equal parts engaging and heartbreaking. While the plot itself feels like a natural evolution of the series’ themes, the story sometimes struggles with pacing. The slow build-up early in the game gives way to frenetic, action-heavy sequences that can leave you wishing for a bit more character-driven depth.

The worldbuilding is a highlight, with Veilguard expanding on lore established in Dragon Age: Inquisition, including deeper exploration of the Fade, the spirits, and the old gods. Fans of Dragon Age II will appreciate the return of certain factions and the way Veilguard expands on those storylines. The cities, villages, and wilds of Thedas are once again beautifully realized, with incredible attention to detail.

## Gameplay: A Solid Foundation with a Few Growing Pains
Gameplay in Veilguard builds on the established mechanics of its predecessors. The tactical combat system returns, with a mix of real-time action and pause-to-command elements that gives players flexibility in how they approach encounters. New abilities, such as the ability to harness the power of the Fade itself, add a refreshing layer to combat.

However, combat at times feels uneven. While battles are intense and strategic, there are moments where the AI companions seem a bit too reactive, failing to execute complex strategies when needed. The new class systems are intriguing, allowing for a wide range of playstyles, but some balancing issues make certain abilities feel overpowered, while others are underwhelming.

The world itself is large, and the exploration remains as rewarding as ever. Whether it’s uncovering hidden sidequests or discovering long-lost relics, there’s plenty to do outside of the main storyline. That said, some of the environments feel a bit familiar, especially for those who’ve played through Inquisition and its DLCs. The new regions, while expansive, don’t always manage to feel as unique or immersive as past zones like the Hinterlands or the Frostback Mountains.

## Characters & Companion Dynamics: Familiar Faces, New Alliances
One of the standout features of Dragon Age has always been its deep, well-written characters, and Veilguard is no exception. The companions are as diverse and complex as ever, with each one offering a personal narrative arc that ties into the broader story. You’ll find yourself torn between keeping old allies close or forging new bonds with members of the Veilguard faction, all of whom come with their own secrets, motivations, and quirks.

The romance options are varied, with an interesting mix of familiar faces from past games and brand new characters to pursue. These relationships are as emotionally charged as ever, giving players the opportunity to explore the highs and lows of companionship in a time of looming catastrophe. While some romances feel more fleshed out than others, most players will find at least one compelling character arc to engage with.

That said, while the companion interactions remain a highlight, there are moments when the dialogue system feels a bit rigid. Unlike the earlier games in the series, Veilguard sometimes feels a bit more on-rails in terms of player agency, and some important choices can feel less impactful compared to what we’ve seen in Dragon Age: Origins or Inquisition.

## Graphics & Audio: Stunning, but With a Few Stumbles
Visually, Veilguard is a masterpiece. The environments are lush, the character models are detailed, and the world feels alive with activity. The reworked character animations and facial expressions are a major step forward, making the emotional weight of key scenes hit that much harder. I never thought I'd talk about hair in a game review but we need to stop and, enjoy some hair. The hair subsystem in Veilguard is something to behold. 

The soundtrack, composed by the talented Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe, delivers sweeping orchestral pieces that match the scale and grandeur of the world. The voice acting is excellent across the board, with standout performances from both returning characters and newcomers. Personally I have 

Unfortunately, there are still some technical hiccups. Frame rate issues pop up occasionally, especially during large-scale battles or in more densely populated areas. While these moments are brief, they do pull you out of the experience and serve as a reminder that Veilguard is a game that still needs a few patches to reach its full potential.

## Final Verdict: A Promising, Yet Flawed, New Adventure
Dragon Age: Veilguard is a game that offers fans of the series a lot to love. The story is rich and engaging, the characters are as memorable as ever, and the world of Thedas continues to be a fascinating place to explore. Combat and gameplay offer enough innovation to keep things fresh, though some balancing issues and technical bugs detract from the overall experience.

Ultimately, Veilguard feels like a solid foundation for future Dragon Age games. While it doesn’t quite hit the same highs as Origins or Inquisition, it sets the stage for a thrilling new era in the franchise. Whether you’re a long-time fan or a newcomer, there’s plenty here to sink your teeth into—though some may prefer to wait for a few updates before diving in fully.
