# Creating Visual Hierarchy with Content Sections

This example article demonstrates how to use the new `ContentSection` component to create visual hierarchy in your articles, similar to the Enabl website design approach.

## Standard Content

This is standard content that appears directly in the article without any special styling or background. It serves as the base reading experience.

<ContentSection 
  background="slate" 
  title="Key Takeaways" 
  description="Important points to remember about visual hierarchy in web design"
>
  - Use color contrast to create visual separation between content sections
  - Implement consistent spacing patterns to establish rhythm
  - Utilize typography scale to indicate information importance
  - Group related elements to create cognitive chunks
  - Apply the 60-30-10 color rule for balanced visual composition
</ContentSection>

## More Standard Content

After a content section, you can return to standard content formatting. This creates a rhythm in your article that helps readers navigate and understand the structure.

<ContentSection 
  background="blue" 
  title="Case Study: Enabl Website" 
  description="How Enabl uses visual hierarchy to create an engaging project showcase"
  fullWidth={true}
>
  The Enabl website makes effective use of full-width color blocks to segment their content and create clear visual separation between different sections. This approach:
  
  1. Creates immediate visual interest through contrast
  2. Helps users quickly scan and identify different content sections
  3. Provides natural pauses in the reading experience
  4. Establishes a consistent pattern that becomes familiar as users navigate the site
  
  Notice how the full-width background extends to the edges of the browser window, while the content maintains a comfortable reading width.
</ContentSection>

## Variations and Flexibility

The ContentSection component offers several customization options to fit different content needs.

<ContentSection 
  background="amber" 
  paddingY="small"
  centered={true}
  title="Did You Know?"
>
  Research by the Nielsen Norman Group found that users spend 57% more time on pages with clear visual hierarchy compared to cluttered, flat designs.
</ContentSection>

For technical content or code examples, you can use a more subtle background:

<ContentSection background="white">
  ```typescript
  // Example of using the ContentSection component
  <ContentSection 
    background="blue" 
    title="Section Title" 
    description="Optional section description"
  >
    Your content goes here
  </ContentSection>
  ```
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection 
  background="green" 
  title="Implementation Tips" 
  description="How to effectively use content sections in your articles"
>
  - Use sections sparingly - not every piece of content needs to be highlighted
  - Maintain a consistent color palette that aligns with your brand
  - Consider the emotional associations of different colors
  - Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors
  - Be mindful of accessibility considerations with color choices
</ContentSection>

## Conclusion

By thoughtfully applying visual hierarchy through components like ContentSection, you can create more engaging, scannable, and professional-looking content.

Remember that good design isn't just about aesthetics - it's about improving the reading experience and helping users better comprehend and retain your content.
