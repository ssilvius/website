excerpt: >-
  My Tacoma on Eagle Ridge in front of what once was Mt. Tacoma. It was all
  marketing. Commencement City changed their name to Tacoma in 1868, they also
  got Nothern Pacific to put their rail terminus in Tacoma.

The mountain's name becomes a focus of Tacoma's city boosters. I mean what could be more amazing for attracting settlers and business than a nearby mountain with the same name as your city, that you really want to be the most important city in the pacific northwest. Today we really would not care at all.

We do know we as a people should not take the name George Vancouver, just someone who stumbled into the Sound in 1792 and bestowed's friends name to the dormant volcano. Just like Mt. Baker, St. Helens, and Puget. Hopefully, the federal government will rename Rainier to Ti'Swaq' like they changed Alaska's McKinley to Denali.
